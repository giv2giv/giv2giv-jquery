# IMPORTANT STUFF #

- Navbar search loading spinner, also expand to fill width
- Pagination in endowments

endpoints for fb/goog:
/auth/facebook
/auth/google_oauth2


# OTHER STUFF #

- Add FB / Twitter Links on the landing page
- New feed for charities
- Endowment slug (in URL) should be its name and not its number

More details in projected tooltip (date, total_donations, total_grants, total_fees, balance)
Pending grants on #numbers

Endowment details:
show active subscription amount (e.g. $30/month)

I put pending grants on #numbers; would be cool to have it on endowment_details too.
