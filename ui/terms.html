</ul>
<p>4.4 Limitations. The following limitations apply to all distributions from Advised Funds:</p>
<p>a. Guidelines: giv2giv only approves grants that are used exclusively in furtherance of charitable purposes. In accordance with that policy, giv2giv reserves the right to perform additional due diligence and to decline to make a recommended grant to a charitable organization, including, without limitation, (i) where the grant will confer a more than incidental benefit on an Donor, other person with grant recommendation privileges, or other third party; (ii) where the grant will be used for lobbying, for political contributions, or to support political campaign activities; (iii) where the grant will be used for improper purposes; (iv) where the Donor and related persons control the organization; (v) where giv2giv provides a substantial portion of the organization’s public support; and (vi) for other reasons in accordance with giv2giv policies. Remedial actions may include but are not limited to requiring that the grant be returned or that the Donor make an additional nondeductible contribution.</p>
<p>b. Frequency of Distributions: Foundation will strive to distribute on a quarterly basis. The Board is authorized to approve additional Fund distributions. </p>
<p>c. Stagnant grants: Grants scheduled/queued but not accepted by a charity within 60 days will be subsumed into the giv2giv general operating fund.</p>
<p>d. More than incidental benefit and financial obligations: Grants may not be used to provide a more than incidental benefit to a Donor or other third party. These include school tuition, scholarships sent directly to individuals, certain dues and membership fees, all or a portion of the cost to attend a charitable or other event, goods bought at charitable auctions, raffle tickets, or certain other goods or services. In addition, grants may not be used to satisfy a financial obligation of any individual or entity (including an enforceable pledge).</p>
<p>e. Minimum Distribution: The Foundation strives to make a minimum yearly distribution across all assets of at least 5%. Due to the grant advisory and approval process, in any year distributions may be more or less than 5% of total assets. All distributions will follow the Foundation’s grant advisory and approval process.</p>
<p>4.7 Requirement of Current Distributions. It is the general intent of the Foundation that an amount at least equal to 1.25% of the net assets of the Fund shall be distributed on an ongoing quarterly basis, unless the Board determines that it is in the best interest of the Foundation to accumulate net income, in whole, or in part, for a specific project, which it is contemplated will be accomplished in a reasonable period of time.</p>
<p>Section 5. Reports</p>
<p>5.1 Annual Reports. A report of all distributions from Advised Funds shall be included in the annual report of the Foundation. Additional reports of Advised Funds may be made as prescribed by the Board.</p>
<p>Section 6. Donor Account Inactivity, Deactivation, and Successor Advisors</p>
<p>6.1 Successor Advisors. The Foundation does not recognize successor advisors. However, at point of donor account deactivation or after having passed the defined threshold of inactivity, the assets remaining in the donor’s account will continue to operate through the same advisement/approval/grant procedure as all other assets in the giv2giv.org fund. </p>
<p>6.2 Inactivity. A donor’s account will be considered past the threshold of inactivity if there are no donations into the donor’s account for a period of one year. </p>
