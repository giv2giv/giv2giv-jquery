		<h2>How it Works</h2>
			<h3>Step 1: Donations go in</h3>
			<p>Support a friend's fund on giv2giv or create your own. Your donations are charged to your credit card or drafted from your bank account and are <strong>tax-deductible</strong> to the fullest extent of the law. <strong>giv2giv is a tax-exempt <span class="nobreak">501(c)(3)</span> nonprofit organization</strong> registered in the United States.</p>
			<h3>Step 2: Funds are invested</h3>
			<p>The giv2giv platform tracks and manages the funds you create within the giv2giv fund. Donations are invested in the <a href="http://www.paxworld.com/advisors/investment-strategies/pax-world-mutual-funds/balanced-fund" target="_blank">Pax World Balanced Fund</a>, a leading Socially Responsible Investment (SRI) mutual fund. All investment gains and losses are tracked at the individual donor level. Our methodology is 100% transparent&mdash;check out our <a href="https://github.com/giv2giv/giv2giv-rails" target="_blank">open-source code</a>!</p>
			<h3>Step 3: Charities receive grants</h3>
			<p>giv2giv makes periodic grants out to donors&rsquo; favorite causes, currently <strong>1.25% of the entire fund every 90 days</strong> for a total annual grant of about 5% per year.</p>
			<p>Now comes the fun part! We send anonymous, unrestricted grants out to charities so they can direct resources where they are most needed.</p>

		<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
		<h3>Why not just donate directly to my charity?</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>With giv2giv your charity can receive a lot more money in the long-run</strong></li>
			<li>giv2giv lets you maintain advisory control over the funds in your funds even after you have donated</li>
			<li>If you wish, your donation can remain anonymous&mdash;no more marketing waste!</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>How does my donation get to my favorite causes?</h3>
		<p><strong>giv2giv uses a Donor Advised Fund</strong> (DAF) as its underlying charitable giving and investment vehicle. DAFs were originally approved by the IRS in the 1930s and are now the fastest growing charitable giving vehicle in the United States of America, with <a href="http://www.nptrust.org/daf-report/recent-growth.html" target="_blank">more than 200,000 donor-advised accounts established holding over $45 billion in assets</a>.</p>
		<p>Donor Advised Funds allow donors to maintain advisory rights to their donations, so you tell giv2giv where your donations should go through your donor &ldquo;advice&rdquo; (the &lsquo;A&rsquo; in Donor Advised Fund). At giv2giv you specify this advice by creating or support a fund that grants to your favorite charities.</p>
		<p>By law DAFs must be sponsored by a nonprofit organization. The giv2giv Donor Advised Fund sponsor is giv2giv, Inc. a Virginia nonprofit incorporated in June 2012.</p>
		<h3>Is subscribing a big commitment?</h3>
		<p>Nope. After you subscribe to a fund, you&rsquo;ll see our green &ldquo;Subscribe&rdquo; button turn into a red &ldquo;Unsubscribe&rdquo; button. Click that button and you are unsubscribed with no additional payments or fees.</p>
		<h3>Are there any fees?</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>giv2giv is committed to sending as much as possible to the charities we support. We've done a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lNheozitbSbxfP4omZY7wiu--iFf3cYbVB-ilRYtCek/edit?usp=sharing" target=_blank>fee analysis</a> that compares giv2giv to other charitable investment vehicles, and we come out looking pretty good.</li>
			<li>giv2giv keeps the lights on with a 0.125% per quarter fee on the balance of the fund. On an annual basis this is one half of one percent which we feel is a great deal for the services provided. In fact, we think this is as low or lower than any Donor Advised Fund or private foundation out there.</li>
			<li>The credit card processor (stripe.com) charges a fee to send money from your credit card to giv2giv&mdash;this is currently $0.30 plus 2.9% per donation. This fee is deducted from your donation prior to being added to your balance in the giv2giv fund.</li>
