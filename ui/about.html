        <h3>Our mission is to revolutionize personal philanthropy by democratizing donor-advised funds.</h3>
        <p>Giv2giv.org is an online fundraising platform that allows people to donate, <em>regardless of donation size</em>, to endowments which provide non-profit organizations with a perpetual income stream of unrestricted grants. Donations can be made to existing endowments or a donor can choose to create their own unique endowment to include the variety of causes which they support. Grants are paid to charities on a quarterly basis and charities are allowed to use the funds for any charitable purpose.</p>
        <p class="lead">Our goals are simple</p>
        <p>
          <ul>

        <h3>Operating Regulations</h3>

        <p class="lead"></p>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>Grants from a Donor Advised Fund cannot result in the donor, advisors or any related parties receiving an exchange of goods or services or any personal or material benefit that is not provided to the general public (for example newsletters). Prohibited benefits include tickets, memberships, meals, preferred parking, preferred seating, discounted merchandise or other preferential treatment from a donee organization.</li>
            <li>Donor Advised Fund grants also cannot be used to satisfy all or a portion of a pre-existing personal pledge or other financial obligation of the donor, advisors or any related parties. Advisors may, however, recommend that a grant be paid out over multiple years, subject to grant approval and annual due diligence.</li>
            <li>Provisions of the Pension Protection Act of 2006, prohibit Donor Advised Funds from making any grants to individuals such as scholarships, emergency hardship grants or disaster relief grants. This includes checks written directly to an individual or checks written to an entity for the benefit of a specified individual. For example a grant to a university for the benefit of a designated student is prohibited.</li>
            <li>Donors, advisors or any related parties may not receive grants, loans, compensation or similar payments (including expense reimbursements) from donor advised funds.</li>
            <li>By making a donation, the Donor acknowledges they have not received any goods, services or other benefits from giv2giv or the charities Donor supports through the Fund.</li>
            <li>By accepting grants, charities acknowledge that no goods, services or benefits have been provided to donors that use the giv2giv platform and that grants are not being used to satisfy any part of pre-existing pledges or obligations made by these donors.</li>
